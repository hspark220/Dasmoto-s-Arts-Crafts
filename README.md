# Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

this project was designed by codecademy, where I made the "website" with the design specifications provided by codecademy.

## technologies

project is created using html and css.

## running the project

after downloading the project, you can open up the html file to view the website.

## project purpose

The purpose of this project was to learn how to create a html and css file from scratch with just a design specification. The only files provided were the image files and the design specification file, and the rest of the website was built from scratch.

## future improvements

There won't be any improvement for the project itself but for myself, I would say that getting better at working with html <div> tags as well as getting better at organizing the css file with the different class tages and elements. I think I struggled with organizing my css file and html file effeciently where there wasn't too much redundant code present in either files.
